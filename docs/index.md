## What is Redis Agent Memory Server?

Redis Agent Memory Server is a production-ready memory system for AI agents and applications that:

- **:brain: Remembers everything**: Stores conversation history, user preferences, and important facts across sessions
- **:mag: Finds relevant context**: Uses semantic search to surface the right information at the right time
- **:chart_with_upwards_trend: Gets smarter over time**: Automatically extracts, organizes, and deduplicates memories from interactions
- **:electric_plug: Works with any AI model**: REST API and MCP interfaces compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others

## Why Use It?

=== "For AI Applications"

    - Never lose conversation context across sessions
    - Provide personalized responses based on user history
    - Build agents that learn and improve from interactions
    - Scale from prototypes to production with authentication and multi-tenancy

=== "For Developers"

    - Drop-in memory solution with REST API and MCP support
    - Works with existing AI frameworks and models
    - Production-ready with authentication, background processing, and vector storage
    - Extensively documented with examples and tutorials

## Quick Example

```python
from agent_memory_client import MemoryAPIClient

client = MemoryAPIClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Store a user preference
await client.create_long_term_memories([{
    "text": "User prefers morning meetings and hates scheduling calls after 4 PM",
    "memory_type": "semantic",
    "topics": ["scheduling", "preferences"],
    "user_id": "alice"
}])

# Later, search for relevant context
results = await client.search_long_term_memory(
    text="when does user prefer meetings",
    limit=3
)

print(f"Found: {results.memories[0].text}")
# Output: "User prefers morning meetings and hates scheduling calls after 4 PM"
```

## Core Features

### :brain: Two-Tier Memory System

!!! info "Working Memory (Session-scoped)"
    - Current conversation state and context
    - Automatic summarization when conversations get long
    - TTL-based expiration (1 hour default)

!!! success "Long-Term Memory (Persistent)"
    - User preferences, facts, and important information
    - Semantic search with vector embeddings
    - Advanced filtering by time, topics, entities, users

### :mag: Intelligent Search
- **Semantic similarity**: Find memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Advanced filters**: Search by user, session, time, topics, entities
- **Query optimization**: AI-powered query refinement for better results
- **Recency boost**: Time-aware ranking that surfaces relevant recent information

### :sparkles: Smart Memory Management
- **Automatic extraction**: Pull important facts from conversations
- **Contextual grounding**: Resolve pronouns and references ("he" ‚Üí "John")
- **Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate memories with content hashing
- **Memory editing**: Update, correct, or enrich existing memories

### :rocket: Production Ready
- **Multiple interfaces**: REST API, MCP server, Python client
- **Authentication**: OAuth2/JWT, token-based, or disabled for development
- **Scalable storage**: Redis (default), Pinecone, Chroma, PostgreSQL, and more
- **Background processing**: Async tasks for heavy operations
- **Multi-tenancy**: User and namespace isolation
