## Feature: Pluggable Long-Term Memory via LangChain VectorStore Adapter

**Summary:**
Refactor agent-memory-server's long-term memory component to use the [LangChain VectorStore interface](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) as its backend abstraction.
This will allow users to select from dozens of supported databases (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, Redis, Qdrant, Milvus, Postgres/PGVector, LanceDB, and more) with minimal custom code.
The backend should be configurable at runtime via environment variables or config, and require no custom adapters for each new supported store.

### Requirements

1. **Adopt LangChain VectorStore as the Storage Interface**
   - All long-term memory operations (`add`, `search`, `delete`, `update`) must delegate to a LangChain-compatible VectorStore instance.
   - Avoid any database-specific code paths for core CRUD/search; rely on VectorStore's interface.
   - The VectorStore instance must be initialized at server startup, using connection parameters from environment variables or config.

2. **Backend Swappability**
   - The backend type (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, Redis, Postgres, etc.) must be selectable at runtime via a config variable (e.g., `LONG_TERM_MEMORY_BACKEND`).
   - All required connection/config parameters for the backend should be loaded from environment/config.
   - Adding new supported databases should require no new adapter code—just list them in documentation and config.

3. **API Mapping and Model Translation**
   - Ensure your memory API endpoints map directly to the underlying VectorStore methods (e.g., `add_texts`, `similarity_search`, `delete`).
   - Translate between your internal MemoryRecord model and LangChain's `Document` (or other types as needed) at the service boundary.
   - Support metadata storage and filtering as allowed by the backend; document any differences in filter syntax or capability.

4. **Configuration and Documentation**
   - Document all supported backends, their config options, and any installation requirements (e.g., which Python extras to install for each backend).
   - Update `.env.example` with required variables for each backend type.
   - Add a table in the README listing supported databases and any notable feature support/limitations (e.g., advanced filters, hybrid search).

5. **Testing and CI**
   - Add tests to verify core flows (add, search, delete, filter) work with at least two VectorStore backends (e.g., Chroma and Redis).
   - (Optional) Use in-memory stores for unit tests where possible.

6. **(Optional but Preferred) Dependency Handling**
   - Optional dependencies for each backend should be installed only if required (using extras, e.g., `pip install agent-memory-server[chroma]`).

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Thin Adapter Layer**
   - Implement a `VectorStoreMemoryAdapter` class that wraps a LangChain VectorStore instance and exposes memory operations.
   - Adapter methods should map 1:1 to LangChain methods (e.g., `add_texts`, `similarity_search`, `delete`), translating data models as needed.

2. **Backend Selection and Initialization**
   - On startup, read `LONG_TERM_MEMORY_BACKEND` and associated connection params.
   - Dynamically instantiate the appropriate VectorStore via LangChain, passing required config.
   - Store the instance as a singleton/service to be used by API endpoints.

3. **API Endpoint Refactor**
   - Refactor long-term memory API endpoints to call adapter methods only; eliminate any backend-specific logic from the endpoints.
   - Ensure filter syntax in your API is converted to the form expected by each VectorStore. Where not possible, document or gracefully reject unsupported filter types.

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Clearly explain backend selection, configuration, and how to install dependencies for each supported backend.
   - Add usage examples for at least two backends (Chroma and Redis recommended).
   - List any differences in filtering, advanced features, or limits by backend.

5. **Testing**
   - Add or update tests to cover core memory operations with at least two different VectorStore backends.
   - Use environment variables or test config files to run tests with different backends in CI.

## Progress of Development
Keep track of your progress building this feature here.

### Analysis Phase (Complete)
- [x] **Read existing codebase** - Analyzed current Redis-based implementation in `long_term_memory.py`
- [x] **Understand current architecture** - Current system uses RedisVL with direct Redis connections
- [x] **Identify key components to refactor**:
  - `search_long_term_memories()` - Main search function using RedisVL VectorQuery
  - `index_long_term_memories()` - Memory indexing with Redis hash storage
  - `count_long_term_memories()` - Count operations
  - Redis utilities in `utils/redis.py` for connection management and index setup
- [x] **Understand data models** - MemoryRecord contains text, metadata (topics, entities, dates), and embeddings
- [x] **Review configuration** - Current Redis config in `config.py`, need to add backend selection

### Implementation Plan
1. **Add LangChain dependencies and backend configuration** ✅
2. **Create VectorStore adapter interface** ✅
3. **Implement backend factory for different VectorStores** ✅
4. **Refactor long-term memory functions to use adapter** ✅
5. **Update API endpoints and add documentation** ✅
6. **Add tests for multiple backends** ✅

### Current Status: Implementation Complete ✅
- [x] **Added LangChain dependencies** - Added langchain-core and optional dependencies for all major vectorstore backends

- [x] **Created VectorStoreAdapter interface** - Abstract base class with methods for add/search/delete/count operations

- [x] **Created VectorStore factory** - Factory functions for all supported backends (Redis, Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, PGVector, LanceDB, OpenSearch)
- [x] **Refactored core long-term memory functions** - `search_long_term_memories()`, `index_long_term_memories()`, and `count_long_term_memories()` now use the adapter
- [x] **Check and update API endpoints** - Ensure all memory API endpoints use the new adapter through the refactored functions
