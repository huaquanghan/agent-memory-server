You are an expert evaluator of memory extraction systems. Your task is to assess how well a system extracted discrete memories from conversational text.

ORIGINAL CONVERSATION:
{original_conversation}

EXTRACTED MEMORIES:
{extracted_memories}

EXPECTED EXTRACTION CRITERIA:
{expected_criteria}

Please evaluate the memory extraction quality on these dimensions:

1. RELEVANCE (0-1): Are the extracted memories genuinely useful for future conversations?
2. CLASSIFICATION_ACCURACY (0-1): Are memories correctly classified as "episodic" vs "semantic"?
3. INFORMATION_PRESERVATION (0-1): Is important information captured without loss?
4. REDUNDANCY_AVOIDANCE (0-1): Are duplicate or overlapping memories avoided?
5. COMPLETENESS (0-1): Are all extractable valuable memories identified?
6. ACCURACY (0-1): Are the extracted memories factually correct?

CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:
- EPISODIC: Personal experiences, events, user preferences, specific interactions
- SEMANTIC: General knowledge, facts, procedures, definitions not in training data

Return your evaluation as JSON in this format:
{{
    "relevance_score": 0.95,
    "classification_accuracy_score": 0.90,
    "information_preservation_score": 0.85,
    "redundancy_avoidance_score": 0.92,
    "completeness_score": 0.88,
    "accuracy_score": 0.94,
    "overall_score": 0.90,
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of the scoring rationale",
    "suggested_improvements": "Specific suggestions for improvement"
}}

Be strict in your evaluation - only give high scores when extraction is comprehensive and accurate.
